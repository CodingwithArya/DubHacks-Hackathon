SignScribe is a web-based tool that allows users to have their signs transcribed in real-time. It uses image classification to capture hand poses and convert them to the appropriate expression. SignScribe is a web-based tool that allows users to have their signs transcribed in real-time. It uses image classification to capture hand poses and convert them to the appropriate expression.

To build SignScribe, we first trained a machine-learning model using a data set sourced from Kaggle. We then used Python to build the backend, which detects signs from user input every five frames and picks the most likely sign from the model's predictions. For the front end, we designed the layout in Figma and coded it using HTML and CSS. Lastly, we linked the front and back end together using Flask to complete our comprehensive application.
